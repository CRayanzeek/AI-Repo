The milestones are working hypotheses as to what the entrepreneur be- lieves can be achieved.Normally, the milestones also relate to real op- tion choices.Attaining a milestone on schedule, for example, suggests that the venture is on track, whereas missing it is an indication that the entrepreneur should reconsider the strategy and may want to modify or abandon the effort.A new venture business plan can fulfill several purposes, serving as a means of benchmarking future performance and a tool for soliciting outside financing, among others.\n",

      "- The Universe of Limited Partners 67  For any venture practitioner, it is imperative to understand the universe of alternative asset investors because each one has its own set of constraints. The largest percentage commitment of capital to venture capital comes from endowments and foundations owing to their relatively lower short‐term cash needs.The smallest percentage commitment comes from insurance companies.  Good entrepreneurs handpick VCs who could be a part of their entrepreneurial journey, yet VCs don’t apply the same fi lters when picking investors.Aydin Senkut of Felicis Ventures ponders “LPs don’t often ask us if we are adaptable.Or if we can build a long‐term platform that can withstand pressures.We aim to be an  antifragile  VC fi rm.”25 NOTES 1.

First Round puts $500,000 in each university fund.The aver- age investment size is $20,000 structured as an uncapped‐convertible note, which is a form of debt that can be converted to equity at a later stage without a cap on valuation.Students don’t have to worry about valuations and can focus on nurturing the business.In addition to funding, First Round Capital partners are available for consultations and conduct training sessions on investment philosophies.Gains, if any, are put back into the fund.There is no intervention in the in- vestment process by First Round unless they come across something legally or ethically wrong.Nor are there any restrictions on the kinds of businesses to be developed, although with a $20,000 investment, most businesses tend to be technology start‐ups.\n",
      "- 3  CHAPTER 1  The Basics  “The key to making great investments is to assume that the past is wrong, and to do something that’s not part of the past, to do something entirely differently.” —Donald Valentine, Founder, Sequoia Capital1 A day in venture capitalist’s (VC’s) life is like that of an entrepreneur—venture capitalists have to pitch a thousand pitches to institutional investors to raise their fund and execute a predetermined plan.If the plan goes well, rewards are distributed; egos are stroked and champagne fl ows.The partners then go back and raise another fund.If the plan goes really well, which is rare, the partners retire, join local nonprofi t boards, or spend time aboard a fancy yacht.A VC’s profession is driven by three primary functions: raise the venture fund, fi nd investment opportunities, and generate fi nancial returns.  RAISE THE VENTURE FUND VCs raise money from fi nancial institutions (called limited partners, or LPs in industry jargon) such as pension funds, foundations, family offi ces, and high net‐worth individuals. (See Figure   1.1 .)Investment professionals or general partners (GPs) develop an investment strategy.Based upon this thesis, its time- liness and robustness, investors commit capital to the venture fund.\n",
      "- A fi rm’s true measure of success is its ability to generate consistent returns over multiple economic cycles.  FIND THE RIGHT INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES  Once the fund‐raising process is complete, VCs are under pressure to deploy the capital.During this investment period, as seen in Figure   1.2 , any fund ac- tively seeks Facebook‐like opportunities to generate target returns.Investment periods can be three years to fi ve years.In this period, the start‐ups come in— the mating dance begins.The pitch deck, term sheets, valuations, and boards Foundations Pension Funds Invest as Limited Partners in VC Funds Fund-of-Funds Individuals/ Family Offices  FIGURE 1.1  Limited partners (LPs) in a venture fund.\n",
      "- Entrepreneurs and Venture Capitalists 5 up.Indeed, Professor Ian MacMillan of Wharton Business School summed up this key virtue of many a successful entrepreneur with the following “Miser’s Axiom”. This attitude to venture creation is at the core of what entrepreneurial management teams often do best – they manage very limited resources.They beg, borrow and salvage in order to propel a new venture as far as possible because they rarely have the resources to make it work. The reality is, however, that most new ventures need a cash injection at some stage and many will require large amounts of cash before they generate revenue.In the biotechnology industry for example, it may take $100 M of investment before a company even gets close to launching a product.Other business models may require substantial early-stage funding in order to rapidly create and embed a viable market position for long-term return on investment and competitive positioning, which could not be achieved through cautious, organic growth. External finance is needed, therefore, when the business is aiming to grow faster than cash flow generated internally will allow.External finance simply bridges the cash flow gap between the start up phase of a new venture and the point at which that new venture becomes self-sustaining via internal cash flows that are sufficient to maintain its optimum growth profile.This is the fundamental, and very simple reason that entrepreneurs need VCs.\n",
      "- 4 Raising Venture Capital business ideas with the aim of securing much needed investment.For VCs the difficulty of trying to select management teams and business ideas they believe will evolve into successful high growth businesses means that in general they “hope for success but plan for failure” when they make investments.The resultant investment agreements between VCs and the entrepreneurs they back are structured to reflect this sentiment and, as we shall see later in the book, many of the deal terms are designed to minimise the VCs exposure in the event of financial failure of the entrepreneurial venture. 1.3 WHY ENTREPRENEURS NEED EXTERNAL CAPITAL A good starting point in any discussion of venture capital is to ask the question “why do entrepreneurs need to raise finance at all?”.It probably sounds like there is an obvious answer too, but why don’t all new ventures start up on a shoestring (i.e. with minimum finance) and simply grow as the cash flow generated from sales allows?Many successful businesses have been built this way and it is a formula that has worked for many types of start Text Box 1.1: The Evolution of Entrepreneurs The word “Entrepreneur” was first used in an economic context by the French philosopher Richard Cantillon in 1755.Cantillon’s original definition of an entrepreneur was a simple trader, with an eye for opportunistic profit.Cantillon’s entrepreneur “bought at a certain price and sold at an uncertain price, thereby operating at risk”.Cantillon’s entrepreneur was, by definition, an individual who specialised in taking on risk and lived on his wits. The economic definition of an entrepreneur was modified a few years later by another French economist, Jean Baptiste Say.\n",

      "        - 2 Other People’s Money  2.1 INTRODUCTION The first point to note about VCs is that contrary to the belief of many novice entrepreneurs, VCs do not sit at the beginning of the capital supply chain.They are not playing with their own money, but in fact with someone else’s.In simple terms VCs are professional fund managers who screen, evaluate, invest in and monitor entrepreneurial new ventures on behalf of the pension funds, banks and insurance companies who invest in the VC fund they manage.In other words, just like many other businesses, VCs are acting on behalf of their shareholders (referred to in this case as limited partners (“LPs”) for reasons we shall explore below). The theoretical role of VCs is to act as financial intermediaries providing sector-specific expertise in sourcing, assessing and investing in entrepreneurial new ventures that the limited partners would find difficult to carry out on their own.The specific expertise of VCs in evaluating new ventures allows them to invest profitably in projects that the less specialised investors who invest in the fund would otherwise reject.By becoming closely involved in the entrepreneurial venture, usually through taking a seat on the board of directors, VCs manage potential information asymmetries between limited partners and entrepreneurs to ensure that once entrepreneurs receive cash from the VC’s fund, they continue to act in the interests of the shareholders in their business. The fact that a VC firm is not playing with its own money, but with someone else’s money is both a blessing and a curse for entrepreneurs.It’s a blessing, because the partners in the VC firm will be much more likely to take investment risks with someone else’s money VC FUND VC FIRM $ $ $ LIMITED PARTNERS NEW VENTURES Early stage high growth ventures $ Source and assess investments Manage information asymmetry Decrease agency costs Pension funds Banks Individuals Corporates Figure 2.1 The fundamental role of venture capitalists as intermediaries\n",

      "- xiv Preface life of a VC fund can materially impact the performance of that fund, and how this, in combination with the investment terms can minimise the impact of poorly performing investments within any given venture capital portfolio. This book is positioned as a professional text, written with a level of detail appropriate to professionals in the area – entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, bankers, lawyers, accountants, consultants, advisors and government policy makers.The book offers deep insights into the deal making process but is accessible to a wider audience via introductory sections for first time entrepreneurs, or those inexperienced in the venture capital field, and for MBA students aiming to embark on careers in entrepreneurship or venture capital.The venture capital business model is largely US-derived and the principles of venture capital deals remain largely the same regardless of geography.Where there are specific local differences we have pointed them out but the lessons we draw are applicable in the US, Europe and other regions. HOW TO READ THIS BOOK This book is structured in three parts: Part I deals with the business of venture capital, exploring initially why entrepreneurs and venture capitalists need each other.We examine how venture capital funds are structured, the dynamics of the venture capital business model, and the competitive environment within which venture capitalists operate. Having explored the business of venture capital, Part II addresses the challenge of raising finance from a venture capital firm.It is here that we pose the question: Is venture capital the right option for funding the business, and if so how should an entrepreneur access venture capital?The venture capital investment process, deal selection and valuation issues are considered and we have provided a number of recommendations and tips for entrepreneurs preparing to embark on fund raising.\n",

      "- 3  CHAPTER 1  The Basics  “The key to making great investments is to assume that the past is wrong, and to do something that’s not part of the past, to do something entirely differently.” —Donald Valentine, Founder, Sequoia Capital1 A day in venture capitalist’s (VC’s) life is like that of an entrepreneur—venture capitalists have to pitch a thousand pitches to institutional investors to raise their fund and execute a predetermined plan.If the plan goes well, rewards are distributed; egos are stroked and champagne fl ows.The partners then go back and raise another fund.If the plan goes really well, which is rare, the partners retire, join local nonprofi t boards, or spend time aboard a fancy yacht.A VC’s profession is driven by three primary functions: raise the venture fund, fi nd investment opportunities, and generate fi nancial returns.  RAISE THE VENTURE FUND VCs raise money from fi nancial institutions (called limited partners, or LPs in industry jargon) such as pension funds, foundations, family offi ces, and high net‐worth individuals. (See Figure   1.1 .)Investment professionals or general partners (GPs) develop an investment strategy.Based upon this thesis, its time- liness and robustness, investors commit capital to the venture fund.\n",

      "- Entrepreneurs and Venture Capitalists 5 up.Indeed, Professor Ian MacMillan of Wharton Business School summed up this key virtue of many a successful entrepreneur with the following “Miser’s Axiom”. This attitude to venture creation is at the core of what entrepreneurial management teams often do best – they manage very limited resources.They beg, borrow and salvage in order to propel a new venture as far as possible because they rarely have the resources to make it work. The reality is, however, that most new ventures need a cash injection at some stage and many will require large amounts of cash before they generate revenue.In the biotechnology industry for example, it may take $100 M of investment before a company even gets close to launching a product.Other business models may require substantial early-stage funding in order to rapidly create and embed a viable market position for long-term return on investment and competitive positioning, which could not be achieved through cautious, organic growth. External finance is needed, therefore, when the business is aiming to grow faster than cash flow generated internally will allow.External finance simply bridges the cash flow gap between the start up phase of a new venture and the point at which that new venture becomes self-sustaining via internal cash flows that are sufficient to maintain its optimum growth profile.This is the fundamental, and very simple reason that entrepreneurs need VCs.\n",
      "- 4 Raising Venture Capital business ideas with the aim of securing much needed investment.For VCs the difficulty of trying to select management teams and business ideas they believe will evolve into successful high growth businesses means that in general they “hope for success but plan for failure” when they make investments.The resultant investment agreements between VCs and the entrepreneurs they back are structured to reflect this sentiment and, as we shall see later in the book, many of the deal terms are designed to minimise the VCs exposure in the event of financial failure of the entrepreneurial venture. 1.3 WHY ENTREPRENEURS NEED EXTERNAL CAPITAL A good starting point in any discussion of venture capital is to ask the question “why do entrepreneurs need to raise finance at all?”.It probably sounds like there is an obvious answer too, but why don’t all new ventures start up on a shoestring (i.e. with minimum finance) and simply grow as the cash flow generated from sales allows?Many successful businesses have been built this way and it is a formula that has worked for many types of start Text Box 1.1: The Evolution of Entrepreneurs The word “Entrepreneur” was first used in an economic context by the French philosopher Richard Cantillon in 1755.Cantillon’s original definition of an entrepreneur was a simple trader, with an eye for opportunistic profit.Cantillon’s entrepreneur “bought at a certain price and sold at an uncertain price, thereby operating at risk”.Cantillon’s entrepreneur was, by definition, an individual who specialised in taking on risk and lived on his wits. The economic definition of an entrepreneur was modified a few years later by another French economist, Jean Baptiste Say.\n",

      "- 4 Raising Venture Capital business ideas with the aim of securing much needed investment.For VCs the difficulty of trying to select management teams and business ideas they believe will evolve into successful high growth businesses means that in general they “hope for success but plan for failure” when they make investments.The resultant investment agreements between VCs and the entrepreneurs they back are structured to reflect this sentiment and, as we shall see later in the book, many of the deal terms are designed to minimise the VCs exposure in the event of financial failure of the entrepreneurial venture. 1.3 WHY ENTREPRENEURS NEED EXTERNAL CAPITAL A good starting point in any discussion of venture capital is to ask the question “why do entrepreneurs need to raise finance at all?”.It probably sounds like there is an obvious answer too, but why don’t all new ventures start up on a shoestring (i.e. with minimum finance) and simply grow as the cash flow generated from sales allows?Many successful businesses have been built this way and it is a formula that has worked for many types of start Text Box 1.1: The Evolution of Entrepreneurs The word “Entrepreneur” was first used in an economic context by the French philosopher Richard Cantillon in 1755.Cantillon’s original definition of an entrepreneur was a simple trader, with an eye for opportunistic profit.Cantillon’s entrepreneur “bought at a certain price and sold at an uncertain price, thereby operating at risk”.Cantillon’s entrepreneur was, by definition, an individual who specialised in taking on risk and lived on his wits. The economic definition of an entrepreneur was modified a few years later by another French economist, Jean Baptiste Say.\n",

      "Entrepreneurial finance is a specialized area of finance that focuses on the unique financial challenges and opportunities faced by entrepreneurs and early-stage ventures. It applies the principles of financial economics to decision-making processes in new ventures. While corporate finance deals with investment and financing decisions of large public corporations, entrepreneurial finance addresses the specific needs of new and growing businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key aspects of entrepreneurial finance include:\n",
      "1. **Real Options Thinking**: Viewing investment opportunities as portfolios of real options, where decisions are made based on future possibilities and flexibility.\n",
      "2. **Value Perception**: Recognizing the difference between the value perceived by investors and the value perceived by the entrepreneur, which influences financial decisions and contract structures.\n",
      "3. **Risk Management**: Managing the high-risk nature of new ventures by considering financing options at different stages of development and adjusting strategies based on milestones and real option choices.\n",
      "4. **Financial Contracting**: Designing financial contracts that allocate value optimally between entrepreneurs and investors, taking into account market competitiveness and the potential for value capture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Entrepreneurial finance is essential for entrepreneurs, corporate financial managers, venture capitalists, and social entrepreneurs to make informed decisions and navigate the challenges of starting and growing a new venture. Understanding the financial economic foundations and utilizing appropriate decision-making tools are crucial for success in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.\n"
