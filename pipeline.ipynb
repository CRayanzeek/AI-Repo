       "  'text': 'less than the synthetic option, the synthetic option would be sold. This transaction would be done by selling short one-half share of stock and lending $23.81. The actual option could be bought for less than $26.19. The risks would offset, and yet, a net inﬂow of funds would occur up front. Either case (i.e., actual option selling for more or less than synthetic option) would be essentially free money. This situation is referred to as an arbitrage opportunity.26 The combined effects of all investors doing these transactions would force the actual option price to converge to the synthetic option price. Consequently, we conclude that the synthetic option price is the correct value of the option. The other type of option, a put, gives the right to sell the stock at the exercise price. If this option were a put, the values of the option at expiration would be $0 if the stock was at $150 or $50 if the stock was at $50. That is, the right to sell a $150 stock at $100 is worth zero when it expires, and the right to sell a $50 stock at $100 is worth $50 when it expires. The procedure for the valuation of the put is the same as for the call except that instead of the call values at expiration, the put values are used. The period of time over which the stock can go from $100 to $150 is the period of time corresponding to a 5 percent interest rate. In other words, $100 invested for one period in a risk-free asset would grow to $105; $100 invested in the stock over this same period would go to either $150 or $50. Suppose the life of the option is two periods and that the interest rate remains at 5 percent for both periods. We shall assume the stock can continue to go up by 50 percent or down by 50 percent. We now have three points in time, which we shall call Time 0, Time 1, and Time 2. The stock prices at Time 2 are denoted as S11, S12, and S22, corresponding to the stock going up twice, up once and down once, and down twice. The situation is illustrated in Figure 22.7.

It uses the binomial lattice to depict the voluntary early exercise decision for an ESO held by a utility-maximizing employee whose outside wealth is invested in an optimal portfolio of stock and bonds. At every node in the lattice, the risk-averse employee compares the expected utility from immediate exercise with the expected utility from waiting for at least one more period. Voluntary exercise is triggered if or when utility from immediate exercise is expected to be the greater—which enabled us to obtain the voluntary exercise barrier for an ESO held by that employee and, hence, to calculate an objective value for the ESO. Furthermore, we generated the full probability distribution of possible individual “price histories” within the lattice and calculated a full distribution of what L, M, and μ an analyst could potentially measure from the associated voluntary early exercises. Using these parameter values in the respective heuristic models, we could then analyze those models’ accuracy rel- ative to the objective option value. HEURISTIC MODELS OF A VOLUNTARY EARLY EXERCISE BOUNDARY To compare the models, we use the following notation: A company’s stock price S evolves with lognormal returns over time t in the interval [0,T] with volatility σ. An ESO is issued at time t 5 0 with maturity T years. The option has strike price X and is issued at the money. We normalize the initial stock price so that S0 is equal to X, which is equal to 1. The risk-free interest rate is r. The stock price process may have a drift reﬂecting a positive risk premium (we use 12 percent drift in our examples), but all valuation of stock options is performed under risk- neutral probabilities. The stock has a constant dividend yield d. We denote the Black\\x02Scholes model value of a European call option with these same parameters as B(S, X, r, d, σ, T, t) but suppress certain parameter arguments when convenient. The employee’s employment may terminate for exogenous reasons at any time with probability q per year.7 The option may have a vesting date, v, which would be less than T—that is, v , T. If employment terminates before time v, the option is forfeited. If employment terminates between vesting and expiry, the option is exercised (in the money) or forfeited (out of the money).8 We study each option valuation model here in the context of a standard binomial lattice model that can easily be adapted to encompass state-contingent σ, r (e.g., term structures of volatility and interest rates), d, q, and v (e.g., performance vesting). The option can be exercised voluntarily by the employee at any time t in the interval [v,T]. The three models differ only in the modeling of a voluntary early exercise boundary. As the stock price evolves over time, voluntary early exercise occurs if it reaches the boundary. An L model has a vertical barrier at t 5 L. An M model has a horizontal barrier at S 5 M. As we show, a μ model has a downward-sloping barrier converging to S 5 1 at t 5 T. “Adjusted Maturity” Approach (an L Model) The lattice version of this model effectively assumes that at time t 5 L (if the option has not already been forfeited or exercised early as a result of termination), an employee will vol- untarily exercise (if S . 1) or the option will lapse (if S # 1). In the absence of vesting restrictions and employee termination, the ESO price obtained from an L model, X(L), is simply the Black\\x02Scholes value, B(L), with modiﬁed option life L. 468 Part IV: Option Valuation'},\n",

       "  'text': 'CHAPTER 18 EARNINGS QUALITY ANALYSIS AND EQUITY VALUATION Richard G. Sloan For years, a widely held belief was that markets are efﬁcient and that fundamental analysis is futile. But after the discovery of several market anomalies, the stage was set for exploring the use of fundamentally based techniques. A simple quantitative trading strategy based on the quality of earnings analysis has worked remarkably well. And although this particular opportunity will inevitably be arbitraged away, it does support the concept that fundamental analysis works. I have long been interested in fundamental analysis, but I was originally told that markets are efﬁcient and thus it is futile to engage in fundamental analysis. Then, academics started to discover what seemed to be violations of market efﬁciency, such as the size effect and the January effect. These violations struck me as being fairly technical and mechanical. Thus, the door had been opened to investigate whether fundamentally based techniques might work. I began by looking at a simple quantitative screen based on the quality of earnings analysis (discussed more fully later). When I ﬁrst back tested this screen against U.S. equity data, I thought I must have made a mistake. I obtained what could be described only as hedge fund returns. Returns averaged about 10 percent a year above the market over the 30 years tested; in only 2 of the years were the returns less than the market. Predictable returns of that magnitude just had not been documented before; returns from strategies based on the size effect and the January effect were a lot smaller. Interestingly, in the 10 years that have passed Reprinted from CFA Institute Conference Proceedings Quarterly (September 2006):52\\x0260.

The fair market value of any asset is deﬁned as the cash price at which the asset would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller if the asset were offered for sale on the open market for a reasonable period of time with both the buyer and seller being apprised of the relevant facts and neither being under any compulsion to act. Basically, it is a freely traded value where cash is being exchanged and no one is being forced to act. When an analyst values a share of stock in a public company with a view toward making a buy, hold, or sell recommendation, the analyst is estimating the fair market value of that share. There is no speciﬁc buyer or seller in mind. What the analyst is looking for in this case is an estimate of the value of that share to a typical buyer. Contrast the fair market value concept with investment value. The investment value of an asset is the value of that asset to a speciﬁc buyer. If known, the identity of the prospective buyer affects the valuation. For example, the investment value of a share of stock to some- one who already owns 49.9999 percent of the outstanding shares can be much different from the investment value of that share to a typical buyer. If an analyst is valuing an entire company, the same analogy applies. For example, suppose that XYZ Corporation announces that it is going to sell one of its divisions. One way to think about the price it might obtain for the sale of that division is to do a fair market value analysis on a controlling basis. In this situation, the analyst estimates what someone who is knowledgeable about that business and competent in managing that type of business would pay. What is the present value of the cash ﬂows to someone like that? Answering that question involves valuing the ﬁrm under the assumptions that operating and ﬁnancial policies are typical of those in that industry. That situation is much different from the sale by XYZ Corporation of a division to a private investment ﬁrm that will likely roll the business up with some other businesses. In this case, a lot of leverage will probably be applied to the transaction and the operating policies of the business will be different. This will have different implications for the value of the business and the sale price that will ultimately be agreed upon. The bottom line is that deﬁning the valuation problem up front is important because it has implications for the choice of valuation method as well as for the information that is used, the assumptions that are made, and the way the selected valuation methods are applied. Although a wide range of valuation methodologies exists, the majority fall within three categories: asset/cost approaches, market approaches, and income approaches. To see how these categories differ, think of commercial real estate. The asset/cost approach might be used for insurance purposes, such as determining what it would cost to replace a structure. The market approach, in contrast, is the evaluation of what comparable buildings sold for on a square footage basis, with adjustments for speciﬁc features of the asset being valued. The income approach involves discounting the present value of the rental stream net of any expenses and investment requirements. The same three categories of approaches are used in business valuation. They are generic to the valuation of any asset. So, what I will do is frame this discussion in the context of asset/ cost, market, and income approaches. I will describe methodologies that use each of the three approaches, the cases in which each approach is useful, the ways in which each approach is used, and the pros and cons of each approach. Although it is not one of the three major categories I just mentioned—asset/cost, market, and income—a fourth approach I will brieﬂy discuss is the contingent claims approach. Contingent claims methods are used to value claims on underlying assets. In that sense, I will distinguish these methods from the other approaches, which value the underlying assets themselves.

Our results suggest that not only is the level of dividends the highest in Australia and Hong Kong (indicated by the larger numbers for the means and medians) but also dividends tend to be the least sticky in these two countries (larger numbers reported for the IQ range). Absolute Valuation Performance of EPS Forecasts We now turn from our study of the relative performance of earnings forecasts (relative to forecasts of operating cash ﬂows and dividends) to an investigation of the absolute perfor- mance of earnings forecasts for all 10 countries. Our objective was to examine whether industry multiples based on earnings forecasts, which have been shown to provide remarkably accurate valuations for subsamples of U.S. companies (e.g., see Kim and Ritter 1999 for companies going public), represent a reasonable source of quick valuations when other U.S. companies and companies in other markets are included. Rather than report simply the IQ ranges for price-deﬂated valuation errors, we provide the entire distribution for each country in Figure 19.1. The horizontal axis in Figure 19.1 contains the midpoints of ranges of width equal to 0.1 (e.g., 0.05 refers to price-deﬂated valuation errors lying in the range between 0 and 0.1, or between 0 and 10 percent), and the vertical axis represents the percentage of the sample in each country with valuation errors that lay within that range. The superior performance of EPS forecasts as a value indicator in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (indicated by the more peaked distributions) and the relatively inferior performance of EPS forecasts in Germany, Japan, and Taiwan are clearly visible. Combining the percentages contained in the two ranges identiﬁed by 20.05 and 0.05 suggests that approximately 25 percent of the sample for the three countries with better-performing EPS forecasts would generate valuations within 610 percent of observed prices.

      "(3) It is also vital to recognise that if the entrepreneur is paying for certain work to be carried out, then he or she should get the full benefit and use of the work product.For example, if the entrepreneur reimburses the VC firm for its due diligence exercise, the entrepreneur should insist on full rights to receive and use all due diligence reports and paperwork generated in that exercise.Not only can this prove to be very illuminating for the business, but it can significantly shorten the time for the business to secure its plan B should the financing transaction fail – as it will in effect have in its possession an independent audit of the business, allowing it both to fix perceived problems in advance of the next financing transaction and/or expedite the implementation of that transaction on the back of a detailed and (hopefully) highly professional set of due diligence papers.As such, reimbursement of expenses to the VC firm should be made only against release of such paperwork to the entrepreneur. (4) The entrepreneur should also push hard for an arrangement under which the VC firm and the company share deal costs – the ratios may be different in various scenarios, e.g. (a) a\n",

      "Deal Management Terms 227 Fortunately, in this area the entrepreneur will in fact find that it has significant practical means to engineer an optimal end result on costs.Obviously, the starting point will be for the entrepreneur to take a robust stance and require that: (1) in the case of a completed transaction, deal costs are borne by the VC fund and capitalised as part of the cost of investment – the entrepreneur can rightly argue that if the company retains 100% of the VC fund’s share subscription proceeds, then that money will work much harder than if it is paid away in satisfaction of deal costs; and (2) in the case of a broken deal, costs (“broken deal costs”) should “fall where they lie”, meaning that each party will bear their own respective costs.This is highly attractive for the entrepreneur and the investment opportunity, because the lion’s share of deal costs under this approach will fall on the VC firm (which is commissioning the due diligence exercise and which will almost certainly insist on its own legal counsel leading on the documentation process).Under this scenario, the entrepreneur will be left only with the fees of its own legal counsel. However, for most transactions this position is unlikely to be fully achievable – particularly as regards completed transactions – and the entrepreneur will have to consider a number of different fall-back positions in each material area.The following are key criteria for consider- ation in developing any strategy in this area: (1) It is essential that deal expenses are properly planned, estimated and managed, to ensure that, whoever bears them, they are objectively reasonable and efficiently incurred.The entrepreneur should insist on a transparent and detailed planning process in advance of the term sheet being signed, giving rise to a transaction plan (essentially three streams of work – due diligence, documentation and satisfaction of conditions precedent) that is agreed by both parties.The entrepreneur can then feel confident in agreeing a cost-sharing arrangement based on delivery against that plan – with costs incurred in excess of or outside that plan falling to the account of the VC firm or to the adviser, unless agreed by the entrepreneur. (2) To the extent that the entrepreneur is agreeing that the business will pick up some costs, he or she should be deeply involved in the development of the action plan and the allocation of resources against that plan.It may be possible to lower the cost of action items materially, for example by allocating internal resources, using the company’s own counsel, or some other clever approach.\n",

      "12 Introduction to Term Sheets  12.1 PURPOSE Parts I and II of this book introduced the reader to the business of venture capital and to the investment process followed by a VC firm.Part III aims to examine in detail the terms that a VC firm will introduce to an entrepreneur in a term sheet at the end of the first phase of an investment transaction, as these terms represent the embodiment of the venture capital business model – the extrapolation of all of the different features of that business model into a set of dynamics that must be operated consistently, investment by investment, across a portfolio in order to generate the VC fund portfolio dynamics demanded by the competitive VC marketplace. Although the ability of the entrepreneur to negotiate freely in this environment may in many cases be severely restricted, because of the relative negotiating power of each constitu- ency, nonetheless Part III aims to identify the philosophy lying behind each component of the terms and conditions of an investment proposal, to explore the “flex” in each of these terms and conditions, to suggest compromises, work-arounds and solutions that may accommodate the wishes and needs of both parties in the relevant circumstances, and to put the entrepre- neur on his or her guard against common areas where value might be needlessly given away or the seeds of future disaster might be sown. 12.2 WHAT IS A TERM SHEET? A term sheet is the document which is developed as part of the second phase of an investment transaction (see Part II above), detailing the essential components of the investment transaction proposed by the VC firm.A term sheet may be extremely short, perhaps as little as two pages, or it may be much longer, sometimes running to some 20 pages or more: the example provided below is relatively long-winded, to aid discussion, but represents a reasonable example of a more detailed term sheet.For other examples, see the websites of the National Venture Capital Association (www.nvca.org) and the British Venture Capital Association (www.bvca.co.uk), each of which carry standard term sheets.The term sheet will invariably be drafted initially by the VC firm and delivered to the entrepreneur for comment and discus- sion (this is the case even if the term sheet is signed when initially delivered to the entrepre- neur – appearing to be final and non-negotiable).Whether it is short or long, the term sheet will invariably cover three key areas: (1) the terms on which funds will be committed or contributed to the investment opportunity by the VC fund, and the arrangements under which the VC fund will hold its interest in the company once it has invested; (2) the work that will need to be carried out to bring the transaction to conclusion, comprising the completion of due diligence and preparation of legal documentation, but potentially also the satisfaction of other conditions precedent specific to the transaction; and\n",

      "    - Investing institutions know better. 4.2.1 Vintage years So, what are the competitive benchmarks against which a VC firm expects to be judged?Wine analogies proliferate in this area, maybe because the industry was born so close to the Napa Valley, one of the world’s leading wine-making regions.A VC fund is judged against\n",
      "- Other People’s Money 13 2.5 CONCLUSIONS So, a VC’s business is operating in the middle of a highly complex capital supply chain.Indeed, this supply chain may well be circular, such that in some small way the entrepreneur may well be funding the VC indirectly out of the revenues from his or her own business.For example, the entrepreneur may make employer contributions to a pension plan for employees and will most likely be paying insurance premia (e.g. for patent litigation insurance, etc): those contributions/premia will be made to the operator of the plan/scheme, e.g. an insurance company, which will invest the contributions/premia in a variety of asset classes, including perhaps a modest allocation (typically in the range of 3–5% of assets under management) to the venture capital asset class, either directly or through a fund of funds.Part of this asset-class allocation might be committed to an investment in the VC’s fund – the VC will draw down committed capital on an as-needed basis, including for investment into the entrepreneur’s business .. .and hey presto, the cycle of cash is complete! As we will see below, the VC asset class has performed consistently strongly against other investment asset-classes over the medium and long term.As we discussed earlier, it is also the case that many top tier VCs have over the years developed a dedicated following of investors who invest again and again.This has both restricted access to these top tier VCs by new LPs looking to invest in the VC asset class for the first time, and has also made it difficult for new VCs to raise a first fund.The VC-LP relationship is, therefore, surprisingly conservative from both directions!Top tier VCs are therefore able to raise new funds very quickly and are in the business of turning away or scaling back investment interest, rather than soliciting new investors at any price.\n",
      "- The Limited Partnership 21 the management fees paid – to ensure that all of an investor’s committed capital is eventually put to work in investments.Fund raising may take up to a year followed by five years of investing and five years of “following on” and harvesting when the focus is on exits and returning profits to the LPs.There is sometimes an extension of the life of the fund when one or two investments remain unexited.3.4.4 Profit share To the extent that the fund realises any investment, the LPs will generally recover their invested capital first.Some funds then allocate a minimum return on investment exclusively to the LPs (known as a “hurdle rate”, e.g. 8–10% per annum), before the GP (or more usually a dedicated entity owned by the VC firm partners) participates in profits, although hurdle rates are more prevalent in the private equity sector than the venture capital sector.Thereafter, any profits generated on investments will typically be shared 20% by the GP and 80% between the LPs (some “premier league” VC firms are able to command profit shares of up to 35%).The GP’s profit share is known as the “carried interest”, because it is an interest in the fund “carried” on the back of the LPs’ capital commitments.These profit share calculations can be made on a deal by deal basis (known as “deal carry”) or on a total fund basis (known as “fund carry”) or on a hybrid basis (known as “modified deal carry”), with committed capital, contributed capital, prior realised losses, unrealised write-downs, etc forming part of an extremely complex matrix designed to provide overall fairness to each interested constituency in the calculation and allocation of VC fund “profits”.Figure 3.3 summarises the cash flow cycle during the venture capital investment process.The GP may be required to repay over-allocations of profit share that may emerge for any reason towards the end of the life of the fund (known as a “clawback”) and individual VC firm executives may be required to provide personal guarantees in respect of any such obliga- tion.\n",
      "- 26 Raising Venture Capital other funds that were launched in the same year, referred to as a “vintage year”.This is because market conditions, and hence investment conditions, may differ markedly year on year, creating an entirely different set of achievable performance benchmarks in one “vintage year”, compared with other “vintage years”.This is exactly like the wine business: one year the weather pattern may be conducive to a great vintage, another year may be the opposite. For example, in the mid-1990s the US economic and market conditions were excellent for VC investment propelled in particular by a wave of technological change engendered by the adoption of the internet as an enabling architecture for business and innovation.Funds in these vintage years not only invested at realistic entry prices, but were able to grow their companies and exit during a long bull market run in which private and public buyers were plentiful.As a consequence, the current mean net return for LPs investing in US VC funds in the 1996 vintage year (after fees, expenses and carried interest) is currently an eye- popping annual internal rate of return (“IRR” – explained in more detail at 4.2.3 below) greater than 90%.By contrast, those US VC funds raised in the 1999 vintage year invested near the top of a bull market at prices that, with hindsight, were too high – and worse then experienced the subsequent market corrections of 2000–2004 which took a terrible toll on businesses and their valuations.As a consequence the current mean net return for LPs investing in US VC funds in the 1999 vintage year is currently a rather more sobering double digit negative IRR. The vintage year concept ensures that comparisons are made like-for-like as funds go through their peculiar performance cycle.It is very common, for example, for VC funds to show negative performance in their early years of investment, as it naturally takes time to grow successful investments to a point where they can be realised at full value (the industry expectation is five to seven years) and, in the meantime, in the absence of the realisation of gains “pregnant” within the VC fund, performance is artificially skewed to the downside in the form of realised losses on failed investments (that don’t get early business traction or which are no longer supported) and the drain of early year deal costs and management fees.\n",
      "- 10 Raising Venture Capital than they would with, say, their own savings allocated for the mortgage, retirement etc; but it’s also a curse, because the nature of risk that a VC firm will take with its investment funds is, in reality, tightly defined by the circumstances in which those funds are made available to the VC firm and by the very fact that those funds are not its own.In short, a VC’s entire business is operated in a fiduciary capacity with regard to the VC firm’s financial backers.Venture capitalists are essentially financial intermediaries whose role is to identify, evaluate and invest in high risk investments that the limited partners would otherwise find difficult to invest in directly.They manage the “information asymmetry” that exists between a potentially complex early stage company and the LPs who usually don’t have the time or skills to overcome this asymmetry.Ultimately, the VCs “decrease the agency costs” of investing – meaning that the LPs would find it very costly to invest without the VC managing the investments for them – principally because of the greater number of wrong decisions they would be likely to make on their own.2.2 THE FUND-RAISING CYCLE Typically, a VC firm will raise funds for investment every two to three years.The fund- raising process will comprise a marathon self-promotion exercise not unlike the trials to which an entrepreneur is put when seeking to raise finance from the VC community.The VC firm will prepare a selling document known as a private placement memorandum (the “PPM”) and the senior partners of the VC firm will then hawk this document (essentially a business plan) and themselves round the fund-raising community, selling their skills, experience, deal-flow network and, above all, their investment track record.Typically, this process can take between six months and a year from initiation of the fund-raising to the ink drying on the investors’ cheques.Sometimes the VC firm will run the process itself; sometimes it will use a professional intermediary; sometimes it will do a bit of both.\n",
